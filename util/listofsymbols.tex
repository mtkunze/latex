% Provides a command to add symbols and track them in a list fo symbols
%
% usage: \addsymbol[opt]{cmd}{vis}{exp}
%          - opt -- plaintext version of the command, e.g., seq for \seq
%          - cmd -- the macro to print the symbol, e.g., \seq
%          - vis -- the actual code to be printed, e.g., \sigma
%          - exp -- an explanation of the symbol, e.g., $\seq$ denotes an 
%                   execution sequence.
%
%
% use \listofsymbols to print a list of symbols (requires to compile twice)
